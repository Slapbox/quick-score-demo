		<h1>QuickScore</h1>
		<p>Fast, dependency-free, and only 2.5K.</p>
		<p>QuickScore is a JavaScript string-scoring and fuzzy-matching
			library based on the <a href="https://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver
			algorithm</a>, and is ideal for interactive matching as a user
			types a query. It improves on the original Quicksilver algorithm by
			tuning the scoring for long strings, such as webpage titles or
			URLs, so that the order of the search results makes more sense.
			It's used by the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quickey-%E2%80%93-the-quick-tab-s/ldlghkoiihaelfnggonhjnfiabmaficg">QuicKey extension for Chrome</a>
			to enable users to quickly search through their open tabs.</p>
